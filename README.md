# Hotel Booking Analysis
Due to increased customer expectations and worldwide competition, the key factors for a prosperous hotel industry have changed over time. Hotels prioritize meeting and surpassing guests' expectations. Information about city and resort hotels can be found in our hotel booking databases. There are approximately 1,19,000 items in 32 variables in this dataset. The purpose of gathering this data is to forecast hotel reservations and the likelihood of cancellations. Understanding the elements that generate money for the company is one of these qualities. Certain characteristics indicate the customer's propensity for making reservations, while other characteristics indicate the causes of cancellations. We own a dataset of hotel reservations. We're performing EDA with our Python expertise to learn more about the variables that influence hotel reservations.

There are two different hotel types in our data study: resort hotels and city hotels. The report contains some aspects that have an impact on the hotel industry. elements including wait times, ADRs, deposits required, and locations. To increase revenue, we need to concentrate on market segments and distribution channels. 

# Project Goal
The goal of the analysis is to use the data to inform business decisions that will optimize the hotel's revenue and customer satisfaction. This may involve adjusting pricing strategies, improving product offerings, optimizing marketing and distribution channels, and developing more effective customer relationship management programs.
