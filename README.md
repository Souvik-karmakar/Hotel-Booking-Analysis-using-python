# Hotel Booking Analysis
Due to increased customer expectations and worldwide competition, the key factors for a prosperous hotel industry have changed over time. Hotels prioritize meeting and surpassing guests' expectations. Information about city and resort hotels can be found in our hotel booking databases. There are approximately 1,19,000 items in 32 variables in this dataset. The purpose of gathering this data is to forecast hotel reservations and the likelihood of cancellations. Understanding the elements that generate money for the company is one of these qualities. Certain characteristics indicate the customer's propensity for making reservations, while other characteristics indicate the causes of cancellations. We own a dataset of hotel reservations. We're performing EDA with our Python expertise to learn more about the variables that influence hotel reservations.

There are two different hotel types in our data study: resort hotels and city hotels. The report contains some aspects that have an impact on the hotel industry. elements including wait times, ADRs, deposits required, and locations. To increase revenue, we need to concentrate on market segments and distribution channels. 

# Project Goal
The goal of the analysis is to use the data to inform business decisions that will optimize the hotel's revenue and customer satisfaction. This may involve adjusting pricing strategies, improving product offerings, optimizing marketing and distribution channels, and developing more effective customer relationship management programs.

# Observations:-

> Hotels with refund policies are more expensive than those without; the former are less expensive.
  
> Transient customers cancel more frequently, although group booking results in fewer cancellations.
  
> The majority of reservations and cancellations are handled by online and offline travel companies and tour operators.
  
> In comparison to resort hotels, there are more cancellations in city hotels.
  
> When hotels do not collect deposits, there is a greater likelihood of cancellation.
  
> Portugal is the nation that generates the most bookings and income.
  
> Africa has the lowest ADR, whereas Europe and South-East Asia have the highest ADR.


# Conclusion:-

In conclusion, the comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the hotel booking trend dataset has unveiled key patterns and insights crucial for strategic decision-making in the hospitality industry. The data strongly suggests that minimizing cancellations can be achieved by implementing a policy of requiring minimum deposits, especially given the high cancellation rates observed when no deposits are taken.

Furthermore, understanding customer segmentation is vital, as transient customers exhibit higher cancellation rates. Offering enticing group booking incentives can significantly reduce cancellations, promoting customer loyalty and satisfaction.

Seasonal trends indicate peak booking months from May to August. Capitalizing on this insight, hotels can strategically introduce special offers and promotions during off-peak seasons to attract more bookings and maximize revenue.

The analysis also underscores the significance of targeting specific geographical regions, with Western European countries—Portugal, France, and the UK—emerging as major contributors to bookings and revenue. A targeted marketing approach towards these regions is advised to further amplify customer acquisition.

In essence, this EDA serves as a robust foundation for strategic decision-making, offering actionable insights that, when implemented, can drive positive business outcomes. The client is well-positioned to leverage these findings for increased revenue, improved customer satisfaction, and operational excellence. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to changing market conditions will be key to sustaining and enhancing the success achieved through these recommendations. The insights derived from this analysis provide a roadmap for the hotel industry to navigate evolving trends and stay ahead in a competitive landscape.
